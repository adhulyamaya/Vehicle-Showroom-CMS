Backend developers test the API without Postman or curl SWAGGER UI can use


Swagger UI is interactive:
You can send requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE directly from the browser.

🔧 Test how your endpoints behave with different:

Parameters

Headers (like Authorization tokens)

Request bodies (JSON data)

ReDoc UI is more of a viewer:
It gives a clean and readable reference for your API endpoints, models, and expected inputs/outputs.

Raw JSON/YAML spec is used with external tools or for sharing your API design with others.
