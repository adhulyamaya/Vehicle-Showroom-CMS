# Vehicle Showroom & Content Management System (Django Backend)

This is a Django-based backend for a Vehicle Showroom & Content Management System.  
It supports user authentication, blog & showroom content handling, and full vehicle lifecycle management — including categories, variants, and pricing. Designed with modular APIs and OpenAPI documentation (Swagger/ReDoc) for seamless frontend integration.

## Use Case

- A platform where **admins** can manage users and post blogs/showroom content.
- **Users (or buyers)** can:
  - Browse vehicles by category
  - View different variants
  - See detailed pricing

This system can also serve as the backend for a **vehicle dealership web app or mobile app**.

## API Testing & Exploration

Backend developers test the API without Postman or curl — **Swagger UI** can be used.

### Swagger UI is interactive:
You can send requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE directly from the browser.

Test how your endpoints behave with different:
- Parameters  
- Headers (like Authorization tokens)  
- Request bodies (JSON data)

### ReDoc UI is more of a viewer:
It gives a clean and readable reference for your API endpoints, models, and expected inputs/outputs.

### Raw JSON/YAML spec:
Used with external tools or for sharing your API design with others.
